# My College App

This application is designed to allow prospective students and their families make better informed choices about the schools they are interested in by aggregarting the data about their schools they want to apply to.  

The data they will be able to see is school name, location, cost, size, acceptance rate, and a number of other important data points about their schools to make the best decision for their education future. 

The site will also allow users to add notes about their schools, and share that info with related parties who are part of their college journey.
